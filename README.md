This project aims at implementing an algorithm to compute the exposure fusion of various pictures depicting a single scene under various exposures. This algorithm is described in:
Tom Mertens, Jan Kautz, and Frank Van Reeth. Exposure Fusion. Available at: http://ntp-0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/j.kautz/publications/exposure_fusion.pdf

This figure shows the global structure of the algorithm:
